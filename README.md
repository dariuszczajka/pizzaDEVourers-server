            "amount": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

## Setup

Required dependencies:
- spring-boot-starter-web
- spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb
- spring-boot-starter-web-services
- spring-boot-starter-test 
- spring-security-core
- java-jwt
- itextpdf
 
Due to security reasons, application.properties isn't provided within the repository. So, in order to run the project, you must create it yourself. 

#### I don't have it just yet
Don't worry - this [_guide_](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database) got you covered. 

#### I got my own mongoDB database
Great! All you need to do is create a new file within the "resources" catalog. Copy this 

```
spring.data.mongodb.database={{YOUR_DATABASE}}
spring.data.mongodb.uri={{YOUR_URI}}
```
into your file (change the credentials - OBVIOUSLY), and save it.


ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! It should work as expected. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
